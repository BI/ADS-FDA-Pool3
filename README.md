###c) Include people in the protype design process

See folders under /Design/Meetings. 

An initial meeting with potential users uninvolved in the design and development process was held on June 18, 2015, and was documented in /Design/Meetings/2015-06-18/MeetingNotes.md. In this meeting, users were assigned personas of a Food Researcher, Financial Analyst and a small Business Owner. An initial idea of what functionality would be useful for these personas was documented, and use cases were created.
