#Usability Test Plan (Version 1.0)

##Document Overview
This document defines a test plan for conducting a usability test during the development of ASD FDA Enforcement Reports web site. The purpose of this test plan is to establish and validate user performance metrics and to identify potential design issues to improve end-user satisfaction.
The following are the usability test objectives:
*	To identify usability issues associated with navigation, presentation, and control usage.
*	To establish user performance baseline for future usability assessments.
*	To provide a user performance measures

##Methodology
The usability testing will take place inside DSoft Technology office using Internet Explorer residing on the laptop and a projector.  Short introductory presentation will be followed by a short review of the ADS Food Allergy Reports web site.  Each test participant will have a chance to navigate the site and provide feedback.
The following measures will be collected:
*	Demographic information
*	Satisfaction assessment
*	Improvement suggestions

##Participants
ADS FDA Food Recall Reports web site will be tested by the following user groups:

| User Group            | Recruitment Method                          | Eligibility Characteristics  | Expected Skills/Knowledge | Number of Participants | Session Length | Test Date |

##Training
The participants will receive an overview of the ADS Food Recall Reports web site. The review will include the following pages based on the user group.

| User Group            | Recruitment Method                          |
| --------------------- |---------------------------------------------|
| Geographic researcher | Landing page (5 minutes) Recall Locations (5 minutes) Recall Frequency (5 minutes) |
| Business researcher | Landing page (5 minutes) Recall Frequency (5 minutes) Enforcement Report List (5 minutes) |
| Financial researcher | Landing page (5 minutes) Public and Company Cost (5 minutes) Recall Locations (5 minutes) Recall Frequency (5 minutes) |

##Procedures

Usability testing will be conducted inside DSoft Technology office in Colorado Springs, Colorado. A laptop with Internet Explorer will be used to conduct the web site overview. Participants will be provided with a PC, IPhone, Android device, and Chrome book to conduct their independent usability tests. 

The participant’s interactions with the web site will be monitored by the facilitator and note taker(s) seated in the same office.  Each test session will be videotaped.  The facilitator will conduct a brief review explaining that the amount of time taken to complete the test task will be measured and the site exploration should not occur until after the task completed. 

The facilitator will distribute a consent that acknowledges the participation as voluntary and that the session will be videotaped with participant’s identification safeguarded. After collecting participants’ signed consent, the facilitator will ask the participants if they have any questions.

After a brief questions/answer session, participants will complete a demographic and background information questionnaire.  Each test task will start with a participant reading a test task description out loud from the printed copy followed by the test implementation. Time measurement begins when the participant starts the task. During the test, the facilitator and note taker will observe participant’s behavior and manually record it using pencil and paper. 

After each task, the participant will complete the post-task questionnaire and elaborate on the task session.  Post-task questionnaire will address usability of the certain web page. After participant completes all tasks, he will complete the satisfaction questionnaire. 

##Roles

The following roles will be included in ADS Food Recall Reports web site usability testing.  An individual may possess multiple roles. Usability tasks may not require all roles. 
###Facilitator

*	Completes satisfaction questionnaire

###Ethics
Participant’s identity should be safeguarded and not be used anywhere outside the testing session. All measures should be taken to discard any personal information collected after data is analyzed.

##Usability Tasks

The test tasks below are required to be reviewed by the development team consisting of the business analyst, developers, and testers. Development review will ensure that the format and the content is suitable for the total web site evaluation. Usability test tasks acceptance will be documented prior to conducting usability test.

##Usability Metrics
Usability metrics refer to user performance measured to satisfy usability requirements. The following usability metrics will be used to measure user performance.
###Scenario Completion
Each test task will require participant to complete particular scenario within designated time period. The scenario is completed when the participant indicates completion or any error.
###Critical Errors
Critical errors refer to the events during the test when the scenario implementation is unobtainable. Such events are unresolved errors during the test tasks or errors that produce an incorrect data. If a participant requires help during a task, then the task is scored as a critical error.
####Non-critical Errors
Non-critical errors refer to the events during the test when the scenario implementation is obtainable after participant’s recovered actions. These errors do not result in processing problems or incorrect data reporting. Such errors are excessing steps and keystrokes, clicking wrong menu item, or any other events preventing task completion in the most optimal way.
###Subjective Evaluations
Subjective evaluations refer to the questionnaire submitted by the participant. Questionnaires will include free-form responses and rating scales.
###Scenario Completion Time
Scenario completion time refers to the time to complete each scenario, which does not include subjective evaluation such as questionnaire. 

##Usability Goals

The following usability goals are set for ADS Food Recalls Reports web site.
###Completion Rate
Completion rate refers to the percentage of the test participants who successfully complete the task without critical errors.  A completion rate of 95% is the goal for each task.
###Time on Task (TOT)
Time on task refers to the time taken by the participant to complete the task from the time the participants starts the task to the time he indicates completion.  Time on task should be reached for each task as designated above.
###Reporting Test Results
The usability test report will be provided after all participants complete testing. The report will contain usability metrics compared to the usability goals. In addition, report will identify usability problems and recommended solutions. Each recommended solution will be evaluated by development team to establish implementation plan.
