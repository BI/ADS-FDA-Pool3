# Meetings on 24 June 2015 #

24 June 2015 - 2/day Scrum discussions centered on the week ahead's schedule, roadblocks and status of prototypes. Product Manager worked through ADS labor categories and descriptions.

At the end of daily scrum, an issue was noted WRT data availability in the open.fda.gov API.  The data originally thought to be in the dataset will not provide the required report for the Financial Analyst.  As a result, a meeting was scheduled with the financial analyst to re-review her requirements.  The meeting consisted of a paper prototype session as shown below where the Visual Designer provided paper prototypes for review and consideration.
