During Spiral 1, the DSoft Technology Business Analyst scheduled a meeting time and assembled a team of potential customers for the open.fda.gov website to initially discuss their needs for the system in a participatory design group setting.  A Food Researcher, Financial Analyst and a small Business Owner each have unique needs, motivations and ideas for the site and express the needs in a functional format, while the business analyst translates their discussion into a use case type format.

The Financial Analyst explains that being able to both print and export data would be useful to her for the studies she has been asked to develop by the GAO.

Above, the Business Owner explains that developing a histogram format graphic from the FDA dataset is going to fulfill most of her initial requirements, but she needs to be able to drill down into the data as well to see details.

The end result of the first customer requirements meeting was that the 3 users emphasized that they wanted an easy-to-use and find web-based interface.  They did not want to have an account and did not want to try to figure out what filters they needed to use or manually type them in.  They wanted filtering to be intuitive and graphical.  Secondly, printing and exporting data in the short timeframe may be a challenge, so they indicated that printing from the browser would be initially acceptable, but long term they wanted more print formatting options.

Specifically,


- The Researcher is interested in determining where food product recalls are most prevalent and wants to use the open.fda.gov to produce a map of the US showing the geographic regions where the most recalls happen to study why and propose solutions.


- The Business Owner is interested in doing business with the FDA and preparing a business proposal.  She wants to know what type of data is collected, frequencies of recalls in order to provide concrete examples of how her business can assist the FDA to recall a product.


- The Government Accounting Office Financial Analyst is interested in the costs of food recalls to both the public and the companies responsible for the recalls.  She is looking for trends to determine if the FDAâ€™s new policies are effective in reducing food recalls over time.



After the first meeting, we scheduled a second meeting with users to play back what we heard.  We then converted their initial requirements and white board session using umlet (a lightweight tool for rapidly drawing UML diagrams [Open Source, GPL]).  The design team was provided the white board product and created the following artifacts during Spiral 1.
